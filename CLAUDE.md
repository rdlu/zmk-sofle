# ZMK Eyelash Sofle — Agent Context

This repo is a ZMK firmware configuration for an **Eyelash Sofle** split keyboard (NRF52840, nice!nano v2). The owner actively maintains and tunes the keymap — expect frequent changes to keys, layers, and hold-tap timing.

## Repo layout

```
config/
  eyelash_sofle.keymap   # main keymap — the file you'll edit most
  eyelash_sofle.conf     # ZMK Kconfig options
  eyelash_sofle.json     # physical key layout (used by keymap-drawer)
  west.yml               # west manifest pinning ZMK version
keymap-drawer/
  eyelash_sofle.svg      # rendered keymap image — regenerate after every edit
  eyelash_sofle.yaml     # intermediate parsed representation
KEYMAP.md                # human-readable layer reference + hold-tap timing docs
.mise.toml               # tasks: setup / build-* / flash-* / draw
keymap_drawer.config.yaml # keymap-drawer render config (icons, colors, labels)
```

## Toolchain (already set up on the owner's machine)

- **Python env**: mise + uv, auto-activates `.venv` on `cd`
- **west workspace**: initialized; ZMK source at `zmk/` is **cormoran's fork** (`v0.3-branch+dya`, for DYA Studio) plus 5 cormoran DYA modules; Zephyr at `zephyr/`
- **Zephyr SDK**: 0.17.0 at `tools/zephyr-sdk-0.17.0` — do NOT use AUR `zephyr-sdk` (requires Zephyr 4.2+, incompatible with the v0.3 base)
- **Serial access**: user is in `uucp` group (required for DYA/ZMK Studio over USB)
- **bun**: provisioned via mise `[tools]` for `mise run studio` (the DYA Studio web app)

On a **new machine**, run `mise run setup` after cloning.

## Common workflows

```bash
mise run draw          # re-parse keymap + render SVG (do this after every keymap edit)
mise run build-left    # build left half (DYA Studio enabled)
mise run build-right   # build right half
mise run flash-left    # copy .uf2 to mounted NICENANO (double-tap reset first)
```

Alternatively, push to the branch and download `.uf2` artifacts from GitHub Actions
(`.github/workflows/build.yml` triggers on `config/**` changes).

## Keymap structure

Eight layers, accessed as follows:

| # | Name    | Access              |
|---|---------|---------------------|
| 0 | BASE    | always on           |
| 1 | NAV     | hold `mo1` (left thumb) |
| 2 | CODE    | hold `lt(2, DEL)` (right thumb) |
| 3 | MEDIA   | hold `mo3` (right thumb) |
| 4 | SYS\|NUM | hold `mo4` (left thumb) |
| 5 | GAME?   | `&to 5` from SYS (right-thumb outer key, pos 63) — transient picker |
| 6 | MINECRFT | picker joystick ↑ (`&GAME_MC_TO` → `&to 6`) |
| 7 | GAME    | picker joystick ↓ (`&GAME_GEN_TO` → `&to 7`) — generic FPS/MOBA |

Right thumb cluster (BASE): `SPACE · lt(CODE,DEL) · CapsWord · ralt_mt(RALT, F12) · mo(MEDIA)`
Left thumb cluster (BASE): `mo(SYS|NUM) · F11 · LGUI · mo(NAV) · BSPC`

### Gaming mode (layers 5–7)

Locked gaming layers that strip all HRM/hold-tap/caps_word so WASD + modifiers are pure `&kp`. Designed in issue #11; re-applied onto current main in `feat/gaming-mode` (the older `gaming` branch / `v2.0.0-rc1` was built on a pre-v1.4 base and is superseded).

- **Entry:** hold `mo(SYS|NUM)` → tap SYS **pos 63** (`&to 5`). The original design used the SYS joystick-center (pos 58), but PR #25 turned the SYS joystick into a mouse (pos 58 = `&mkp LCLK`), so entry moved to the free right-thumb outer key.
- **Picker (layer 5, "GAME?"):** joystick ↑ → MINECRFT, ↓ → generic GAME, center → `&to 0` (cancel). All other keys `&none`.
- **Game chassis (layers 6 & 7, identical except pos 0):** `LCTRL`@39 (pinky), `LSHIFT`@57 (left thumb), `SPACE`@56 + @59 (both thumbs), `BSPC`@60, `LALT`@61, `F13`@62 (PTT), `mo(MEDIA)`@63. Joystick = audio cluster (Vol±/Mute/PlayPause) + center Enter. pos 0: MC = `F3`, generic = `` ` ``.
- **Exit/switch combos:** `0 + 12` → `&GAME_EXIT` (RGB off + `&to 0`); `0 + 5` → `&to 5` (re-pick). Both scoped `layers = <6 7>`.
- **RGB feedback** (`GAME_MC_TO`/`GAME_GEN_TO` set `RGB_COLOR_HSB`): only visible on battery/BLE — `CONFIG_ZMK_RGB_UNDERGLOW_AUTO_OFF_USB=y` kills it on USB. OLED `display-name` is the primary indicator.

## Key position numbering

The keymap has 64 positions (used in `hold-trigger-key-positions`):

```
Rows 0–3: 13 keys each (6 left + 1 encoder-click + 6 right), positions 0–51
Row 4:    12 keys      (5 left + 1 encoder-click + 5 right, + 1 encoder), positions 52–63

Left half:  cols 0–5 of each row
Right half: cols 7–12 of each row (col 6 = encoder click)
```

Left-side positions:  `0-5, 13-18, 26-31, 39-44, 52-57`
Right-side positions: `7-12, 20-25, 33-38, 46-51, 58-63`

## Hold-tap behaviors

Three behaviors defined in the `behaviors {}` block — all share the same core timing.
See **KEYMAP.md** for the full timing reference and tuning tips.

| Behavior | Used on | Positional restriction |
|----------|---------|------------------------|
| `hml` | D(LCTRL) F(LSHFT) G(LALT) | triggers only when right-side keys pressed |
| `hmr` | H(LALT) J(RSHFT) K(RCTRL) | triggers only when left-side keys pressed |
| `ralt_mt` | right-thumb F12 (tap = F12, hold = RALT) | none — AltGr combos span both hands and live on the thumb |

Current timing: `tapping-term-ms=280`, `require-prior-idle-ms=150`, `quick-tap-ms=175`, `flavor=balanced`.

## After every keymap edit

1. Run `mise run draw` to regenerate the SVG
2. Stage `config/eyelash_sofle.keymap`, `keymap-drawer/eyelash_sofle.yaml`, `keymap-drawer/eyelash_sofle.svg` together
3. Commit and push — GitHub Actions will build the firmware automatically
4. Update the open PR description to reflect the current state of all layers and behaviors
5. Post a PR comment summarising what changed in this interaction (what the user asked for, what was changed and why)

## Branch / PR conventions

- Always work on a feature branch and keep an open PR — **never commit directly to `main`** unless explicitly asked
- Active branch: `feat/gaming-mode` (gaming layers 5–7, re-applied onto v1.6.0). Create a new branch/PR if starting a distinct new topic
- Main branch is `main`

### PR description hygiene

The PR description is the canonical summary of everything on the branch. Keep it current:
- After every push, update the **Summary** section to reflect the actual current state of all layers and behaviors
- If a behavior or key was changed, the old description is wrong — fix it

### PR comments as a change log

After each push, post a comment on the PR documenting what happened in that interaction:
```
gh pr comment <number> --body "..."
```
Include: what the user requested, what was changed (layer/key/behavior), and any non-obvious rationale (e.g. why ralt_mt has no positional restriction). This creates a useful history of decisions for future sessions.

## Important gotchas

- **Do not change the Zephyr SDK version** without verifying ZMK compatibility
- `keymap-drawer` CLI is `keymap` (not `keymap-drawer`) when invoked via `uvx --from keymap-drawer`
- The `eyelash_sofle/` directory is the vendor source — do not edit it; edit `config/` only
- Firmware is **shield-based** (since v2.5.0): build `-b nice_nano_v2 -DSHIELD="eyelash_sofle_left nice_view"`. The shield comes from the `eyelash_sofle` west module (pinned to the dya commit). The old tracked `boards/arm/eyelash_sofle/` board + root `zephyr/module.yml` were removed — they collided with the same-named shield.
- **DYA Studio** = cormoran's ZMK fork + modules → keymap editing over USB **and BLE**. Central-only studio/RPC/BLE Kconfig ships in the module's `eyelash_sofle_left.conf`; keep it OUT of the shared `config/eyelash_sofle.conf`. Left half also gets the `studio-rpc-usb-uart` snippet (USB); right half is the peripheral (no central flags).
- `soft_off` hold time is 2000 ms (combo: Q+A+Z simultaneously)
- **Local left-half build needs `protobuf >= 7.35`** in `.venv` (nanopb gencode for the Studio build). If `mise run build-left` fails with a protobuf "gencode/runtime" VersionError, run `uv pip install --upgrade 'protobuf>=7.35'`. The right half doesn't build Studio, so it's unaffected.
- **Gaming entry is SYS pos 63, not pos 58** — pos 58 (joystick-center) is the mouse left-click since PR #25. Don't reuse it for `&to GAME`.
